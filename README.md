# Battleship
Portfolio project for OSU 162: Variation of Battleship

## About
Allows two players to play a variation of the game [Battleship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)). Each player has their own 10x10 grid they place their ships on. On their turn, they can fire a torpedo at a square on the enemy's grid. Player 'first' gets the first turn to fire a torpedo, after which players alternate firing torpedos. A ship is sunk when all of its squares have been hit. When a player sinks their opponent's final ship, they win.
